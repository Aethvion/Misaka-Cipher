MISAKA CIPHER - EVOLUTION LOGIC (TOOL CREATION & VALIDATION)
Core architecture is consistent; tool implementations evolve during agentic sprints. Updated: 2026-02-25.

OVERVIEW
The Forge is Misaka Cipher's self-evolution engine. It autonomously writes Python code to expand system capabilities. Philosophy: if the system encounters a problem it cannot solve, it creates a tool to solve it; that tool becomes part of the permanent toolkit.

TOOL CREATION PIPELINE (4 PHASES)
Phase 1: Analysis -> Phase 2: Generation -> Phase 3: Validation -> Phase 4: Registration -> Tool Available System-Wide

PHASE 1: ANALYSIS (forge/tool_forge.py::forge_tool())
Step 1.1: Load model registry (config/model_registry.json) to know available providers, API key env vars, and model capabilities. Needed so generated tools know which APIs they can call.
Step 1.2: Build provider context string listing providers, key env vars, and model capabilities. This prevents generated tools from using placeholder URLs or invalid API keys.
Step 1.3: Extract tool specification via LLM analysis. LLM extracts: domain (e.g. Data, Code, Image, Math), action (e.g. Read, Write, Generate, Analyze), object (e.g. CSV, JSON, Image, File), parameters (input/output requirements). Output is ToolSpec(name, description, parameters, returns) following Aethvion Standard [Domain]_[Action]_[Object].
Example ToolSpec output: name="Data_Analysis_CSV", description="Analyzes CSV files and returns statistics", parameters=[{name="filepath", type="str", required=True}, {name="columns", type="List[str]", required=False}], returns="Dict[str, Any]"

PHASE 2: GENERATION (forge/code_generator.py::generate_tool_code())
Step 2.1: Select template. Standard tool template includes: description header, trace_id, timestamp, type imports, API imports, function name, parameters, return type, docstring with Args/Returns/Raises, try-except block, self-test in __main__.
Step 2.2: Generate implementation via LLM with requirements: use type hints, include error handling (try-except), no placeholder URLs (use actual API endpoints), no placeholder API keys (use os.environ.get()), PEP 8 style, include docstring, add self-test in __main__ block. Uses Flash model for code generation.
Step 2.3: Inject API keys automatically. Generated tools check os.environ for available keys and fall back between providers. Pattern: check google_key = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"), if available use Imagen/Gemini; elif openai_key use DALL-E/GPT; else raise RuntimeError. No hard-coded credentials.
Step 2.4: Assemble complete tool by filling template with generated implementation, imports, docstrings, and self-test.

PHASE 3: VALIDATION (forge/tool_validator.py::validate_tool())
Step 3.1: Syntax validation. ast.parse() must succeed. Failure severity: critical -> rejection, no registration.
Step 3.2: Security scanning. Checks for: eval() or exec() presence (arbitrary code execution), subprocess.run with shell=True (injection risk), open() calls accessing paths outside outputfiles (unauthorized file access), regex match of (api_key|password|secret).*(print|log) (credential leakage). Any issue -> critical -> rejection.
Step 3.3: Aethvion compliance. Name must match pattern [A-Z][a-zA-Z]+_[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+_[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+. Domain must be in approved list (Data, Code, System, Network, Image, Text, Math, Finance, Security, Database, File). Non-compliance: auto-fix if possible, else warn, else reject.
Step 3.4: Functional validation (roadmap). Currently manual via __main__ self-test block. Future: sandboxed execution with assertion checks on test inputs.
Readiness criteria: syntax valid AND security clean AND naming correct AND documentation present (docstring with Args/Returns) AND error handling present (try-except block) AND self-test passes.

PHASE 4: REGISTRATION (forge/tool_registry.py::register_tool())
Step 4.1: File persistence. Save to tools/generated/[domain]_[action]_[object].py, set executable permissions (0o755).
Step 4.2: Registry update. Add entry to tools/registry.json with fields: name, path (relative to cwd), description, parameters ([{name, type, required, description}]), returns, created_at (ISO-8601), trace_id (MCTR-...), status ("active").
Step 4.3: Knowledge graph update. Add tool node with metadata (description, parameters, created_at). Add domain node if not exists. Add belongs_to edge (Tool -> Domain:domain). Analyze implementation for tool dependencies and add uses edges.

DECISION TREE: WHEN IS A TOOL READY
Syntax valid? NO -> REJECT (critical). YES -> Security pass? NO -> REJECT (critical). YES -> Aethvion compliant? NO -> auto-fix -> fixed? NO -> REJECT; YES -> Register Tool -> Update Knowledge Graph -> TOOL IS READY.
On readiness: saved to tools/generated/, added to tools/registry.json, registered in knowledge graph, immediately available system-wide.

TOOL LIFECYCLE STATES
active - initial state on registration; tool available for use by agents, orchestrator, and users
testing - tool available but flagged as experimental; includes testing_until timestamp field
deprecated - tool superseded by newer version; system warns users and suggests alternative; includes deprecated_at and superseded_by fields
archived - tool removed from active registry; includes archived_at field

SELF-IMPROVEMENT MECHANISM
Cycle 1: basic capability. User requests -> system forges single tool -> capability added.
Cycle 2: building on previous. User requests more complex task -> system reuses existing tools + forges new ones.
Cycle 3: complex pipelines. Multiple existing tools combined with newly forged tools to form complete pipelines.
Exponential growth pattern: Week 1: ~5 tools, Week 2: ~15 tools (10 new, many using Week 1 tools), Week 4: ~50 tools, Week 12: 200+ tools (fully self-sustaining ecosystem).
Tool reuse analytics tracked per tool: times_used, used_by_agents, used_by_tools (other tools depending on this one), avg_success_rate, last_used. Used to identify high-value tools, detect unused tools (deprecation candidates), recognize common patterns, and optimize frequently used tools.

VALIDATION FEEDBACK LOOP
Detection: tool crash logged with trace_id; system tracks failure count per tool.
Response when failure_count > 5: automatic re-generation attempt with improved description referencing common error and original tool as baseline. If new version passes validation: deprecate old version, register new version with supersedes field pointing to original.
Self-healing: system automatically improves failed tools without human intervention.

TOOL TEMPLATES (FUTURE)
API Client template: class with __init__ loading API key from env and setting base_url, plus methods using requests with Authorization header. Triggered when system detects "Create API client for X" pattern.
Data Processor template: function with input validation, item processing loop, and aggregation step. Triggered for batch transformation patterns.

QUALITY METRICS
Tool generation success rate: ~95% first-attempt (target >90%). Breakdown: ~3% fail security, ~1.5% fail syntax, ~0.5% fail Aethvion.
Tool reliability: ~99% execution success rate (target >95%).

EVOLUTION SUMMARY
The Forge enables five self-capabilities: Self-Extend (create new capabilities autonomously), Self-Improve (regenerate failed tools automatically), Self-Organize (build tool chains and pipelines), Self-Document (generate documentation for all tools), Self-Optimize (track usage and deprecate unused tools).
Result: system becomes exponentially more capable over time without human intervention.
Key insight: every tool forged is a permanent upgrade; better tools enable more complex tasks which require new tools which improve capability further. This is true self-evolution.
