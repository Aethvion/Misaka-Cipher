## 🎯 What Is Aethvion Suite?

Aethvion Suite is a **self-hosted AI assistant platform** and application hub. It connects to cloud AI providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, xAI Grok, Anthropic Claude) and provides a structured environment for running chat threads, generating tools, and spawning agents — all from a local server you control.

The core system features **Misaka Cipher**, a specialized chat interface and assistant kernel.

---

## ✅ What Works Right Now

These features are functional in the current build:

### 💬 Chat & Threads
- Multi-provider chat (Google, OpenAI, Grok, Anthropic) with automatic failover
- Persistent conversation threads with configurable context modes (none / smart / full)
- Instant thread creation with automatic intelligent titling based on context
- Collapsible, flush-edge chat UI with persistent layout state memory
- Per-message model selection or **auto-routing** (LLM picks the best model from your enabled pool)
- Thread memory: task JSONs stored on disk, model used + routing reasoning recorded

### 🤖 Agent Mode
- Basic agent spawning for analysis and execution tasks
- Intent detection routes messages to chat or agent execution
- Step-by-step execution visible in the System Terminal panel

### ⚒️ Tool Forge
- AI can generate Python tools and register them for reuse
- Generated tools are saved locally and available in subsequent sessions
- Works for simple, well-scoped tool requests — complex multi-file generation is hit or miss

### 🧠 Memory
- Episodic memory stored in ChromaDB (vector search)
- Every conversation stored as a task JSON with model, routing, and usage metadata
- Memory can be queried in subsequent sessions

### 🎙️ Audio
- Text-to-speech and speech-to-text support
- Configurable voice and audio output settings

### 🎮 Games
- Built-in games playable from the dashboard: Logic Quest, Blackjack, Sudoku, Word Search, Checkers (vs AI)
- Leaderboard to track scores across sessions

### 🎭 Aethvion VTuber & 📊 Aethvion Tracking
- **Aethvion VTuber:** Visualization and animation engine for digital character presence — rigging, real-time deformation.
- **Aethvion Tracking:** Advanced motion tracking module — streams real-time tracking parameters to VTuber via WebSocket.

### 🔌 Nexus Module
- Peripheral and sensor plugin hub — connects the AI to physical/digital inputs (screen capture, webcam, Spotify, weather, system info)
- Registry-driven architecture for adding new integrations

## ⚠️ What Doesn't Work Yet (or Is Rough)

Be aware of these limitations before you dive in:

- **Autonomous long-running tasks:** The system cannot reliably work toward a complex goal over hours or days without supervision. Agent execution works for single well-defined tasks, not multi-step plans.
- **Self-improvement:** The system does not meaningfully "learn" or improve itself between sessions. Memory is stored but not yet deeply integrated into decision-making.
- **Local model support:** Ollama/vLLM integration is not implemented. All inference goes to cloud providers (costs real money).
- **Tool forge reliability:** Simple tools generate fine. Anything requiring external libraries, complex logic, or multi-file output is unreliable.
- **90% cost reduction claim from older docs:** Not realistic in current form. All calls go to cloud APIs. Cost depends entirely on your usage and model choices.
- **Production-readiness:** This is a personal/research project. It is not hardened for production use.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is structured around four components:

| Component | Role | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Nexus Core** | Single entry point — routes all requests, manages trace IDs | ✅ Stable |
| **The Factory** | Spawns transient worker agents for complex tasks | 🧪 Works for basic tasks |
| **The Forge** | Generates Python tools autonomously | 🧪 Works for simple tools |
| **Memory Tier** | ChromaDB episodic memory + knowledge graph | ✅ Stores data, retrieval basic |

**Providers supported:** Google AI (Gemini), OpenAI (GPT-4o family), xAI (Grok), Anthropic (Claude)

**Intelligence Firewall:** PII/credential scanning before any external API call — blocks sensitive data from leaving.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Aethvion/Aethvion-Suite.git
cd Aethvion-Suite

# Install dependencies (uses pyproject.toml)
pip install -e ".[memory]"

# Copy and fill in your API keys
copy .env.example .env
# edit .env — add GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY / GROK_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Optional: add DISCORD_TOKEN to enable the Discord bot integration
```

### Launch

**One-click (Windows):**  
Double-click `Start_Aethvion_Suite.bat` — it creates the virtual environment, installs dependencies, and starts the dashboard automatically. It also includes a **Smart Tab** check to prevent opening duplicate browser tabs.

**Manual:**
```bash
python -m core.main          # web dashboard (default)
python -m core.main --cli    # interactive CLI
python -m core.main --test   # run verification tests
```
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or your configured `PORT`) after launch.
