## 🎯 What Is Aethvion Suite?

Aethvion Suite is a **self-hosted AI assistant platform** that connects to cloud providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, xAI Grok, Anthropic Claude) and local GGUF models via llama-cpp-python. It gives you a structured environment for running chat threads, generating tools, spawning agents, and interacting with a growing set of integrated apps — all from a server you own and control.

There are **two main components** to the ecosystem:

### 1. Aethvion Suite Core
The central intelligence hub and management platform. It provides the dashboard, API orchestration, and foundational AI services.

| Interface | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Web Dashboard** | 25+ tab control center — chat, agents, tools, memory, games |
| **Core Terminal** | CLI mode for headless use, scripting, and developer queries |

### 2. Standalone Integrated Applications
Professional-grade tools built on the Aethvion core. Each app runs as a standalone server but integrates seamlessly into the main dashboard.

| App | Role | Default Port |
|-----|------|--------------|
| **Aethvion Code IDE** | VS Code-powered IDE with AI chat and execution | 8083 |
| **Aethvion VTuber** | 2D character rigging and animation engine | 8081 |
| **Aethvion Audio** | Multi-track timeline editor and effects processor | 8081* |
| **Aethvion Photo** | Layer-based image generation and editor | 8081* |
| **Aethvion Tracking** | AI-powered facial motion capture bridge with HUD | 8081* |
| **Aethvion Drive Info** | Interactive disk space and storage analyzer | 8084 |
| **Aethvion Finance** | Personal financial tracking, portfolio, and AI market analysis | 8081* |
| **Aethvion Hardware Info** | System hardware information and monitoring | 8081* |

*\* Note: Apps sharing port 8081 will automatically negotiate the next available port (8082, etc.) if multiple are running simultaneously.*

The AI core features **Misaka Cipher**, backed by four subsystems:

| Component | Role | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Nexus Core** | Single entry point — routes all requests, manages trace IDs | ✅ Stable |
| **The Factory** | Spawns transient worker agents for complex tasks | 🧪 Works for basic tasks |
| **The Forge** | Generates Python tools autonomously | 🧪 Works for simple tools |
| **Memory Tier** | ChromaDB episodic memory + knowledge graph | ✅ Storage stable, retrieval improving |

**Cloud Providers:** Google AI (Gemini) · OpenAI (GPT-4o) · xAI (Grok) · Anthropic (Claude)
**Local Models:** GGUF via llama-cpp-python (Mistral, LLaMA, Phi, and others)
**Intelligence Firewall:** PII/credential scanning before any external API call — blocks sensitive data from leaving.

## ✅ What Works Right Now

### 💬 Chat & Threads
- Multi-provider chat (Google, OpenAI, Grok, Anthropic) with automatic failover
- Local GGUF model inference via llama-cpp-python — no cloud required
- Persistent conversation threads with configurable context modes (none / smart / full)
- Per-message model selection or **auto-routing** (LLM picks the best model from your enabled pool)
- Collapsible, flush-edge chat UI with persistent layout state memory

### 🤖 Agent Workspaces
- **Agent Workspaces tab**: Create named workspaces, each with their own thread history
- **Agent threads**: Start tasks from a workspace — the agent runner executes them step-by-step in a chosen folder
- **ReAct-style execution loop**: Agent reads files, writes files, lists directories, and runs shell commands to complete tasks
- **Real-time SSE streaming**: Each agent action and result streams live to the dashboard via Server-Sent Events
- **Step history**: Previous runs are saved and re-rendered when revisiting a thread; actions and results displayed inline
- Folder browser for selecting a workspace directory on the server filesystem

### ⚒️ Tool Forge
- AI can generate Python tools and register them for reuse
- Generated tools are saved locally and available in subsequent sessions

### 🧠 Memory
- Episodic memory stored in ChromaDB (vector search)
- Every conversation stored as a task JSON with model, routing, and usage metadata

### 💻 Code IDE
- Full Monaco editor (VS Code engine) with syntax highlighting for 30+ languages
- AI copilot: chat, explain, fix, complete, refactor — all with streaming responses
- **Chat thread system** — create, rename, switch, and delete threads per workspace; threads persist between sessions
- **File creation from chat** — the AI uses `### FILE:` markers; files are written to disk automatically
- **Python-exec blocks** — AI outputs Python code for file operations; executed server-side with Approve/Deny security toggle
- Code execution: Python, Node.js, Bash/Shell — output streams live to the built-in terminal via SSE
- **Ctrl+P fuzzy file finder palette** — quickly open any file with substring and character-sequence scoring
- **Status bar** — shows git branch, language, cursor position, and dirty-state indicator
- **AI Project Notes panel** — saved per-workspace and auto-injected into every AI system prompt
- Apply/Copy buttons on AI chat code blocks; collapsed file write cards with expand-on-click
- **AI continuation loop** — automatically chains follow-up calls so large tasks don't get cut off mid-response
- File context menu: Move to…, Duplicate, Delete, Open in Explorer actions
- Usage logging compatible with the dashboard Usage tab (logged under `data/ai/logs/usage/`)
- Persistent workspace state — remembers open tabs, last workspace, and recent projects per folder
- Project context injection — the AI receives your workspace file structure on every request
- Native OS folder picker for workspace selection
- Resizable 3-panel layout: file tree · Monaco editor · AI chat

### 🎙️ Audio Interaction (Core)
- Built-in Text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) support within the dashboard and chat.
- **Misaka TTS voice UI** — select voice profiles directly from the chat interface.
- **Local TTS/STT routing** — routes to local audio models when loaded, falls back to browser/API.
- Configurable voice profiles and audio processing settings.

### 🔊 Local Audio Models
- **Audio Models tab** in the dashboard for managing local TTS and STT models.
- **Kokoro** (TTS) — lightweight, fast local text-to-speech model.
- **XTTS-v2** (Coqui TTS) — high-quality TTS with voice cloning support; cloned voice WAVs stored under `localmodels/audio/voices/`.
- **Whisper** (faster-whisper) — accurate local speech-to-text transcription.
- Model lifecycle management: load/unload models, generate TTS, transcribe audio, manage cloned voices, and install pip packages via the dashboard.
- Models stored under `localmodels/audio/`; GGUF chat models under `localmodels/gguf/`.

### 🎵 Aethvion Audio (Standalone)
- Full multi-track timeline editor with per-track volume, solo, and pan.
- Professional waveform visualization with gradient rendering and real-time effects.
- Format conversion and effects pipeline (Normalization, Gain, Pitch, Speed).

### 🎮 Games
- Built-in games: Logic Quest, Blackjack, Sudoku, Word Search, Checkers (vs AI)
- Leaderboard to track scores across sessions

### 🎭 VTuber & 📊 Tracking
- **Aethvion VTuber:** Visualization and animation engine — rigging, real-time deformation, preview/live modes
- **Aethvion Tracking:** Motion tracking via WebSocket at port 8082, streams parameters directly to the VTuber viewer
- **Revamped Tracking UI** with a live HUD overlay, real-time telemetry readout, and FPS counter
- Live mode auto-discovers the tracking server; browser connects directly with auto-reconnect

### 🔌 Nexus Module
- Peripheral plugin hub — screen capture, webcam, Spotify, weather, system info
- Registry-driven architecture for adding new integrations

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Autonomous long-running tasks:** Agent execution works for single well-defined tasks, not multi-step plans over hours or days.
- **Memory integration:** Memory is stored reliably but not yet deeply wired into agent decision-making.
- **Tool forge reliability:** Simple tools generate fine; anything requiring external libraries or complex multi-file output can be unreliable.
- **Ollama / vLLM:** Not yet supported. Local inference uses llama-cpp-python (GGUF files) directly.
- **Production hardening:** This is a personal/research project, not audited or hardened for production deployments.
