# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Philosophy

Misaka Cipher takes security seriously. As a self-evolving AI system that can generate code and spawn agents, we implement multiple layers of security:

* **Intelligence Firewall**: Pre-flight scanning for PII and credentials
* **Code Validation**: All generated tools are validated before execution
* **Provider Isolation**: API keys are isolated and never exposed to generated code
* **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability with Trace_ID for all operations

## 🔒 Supported Versions

We release security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Opening a Security Advisory** on GitHub:
   * Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Aethvion/Misaka-Cipher/security)
   * Click "Report a vulnerability"
   * Fill in the details

2. **Opening a private issue** with the label `security`:
   * Create an issue but mark it as confidential
   * Use the title prefix: `[SECURITY]`

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

* **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., code injection, privilege escalation, etc.)
* **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
* **Location of the affected code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
* **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
* **Impact** of the vulnerability
* **Possible fixes** (if you have suggestions)

### Response Timeline

* **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
* **Status Update**: Within 7 days
* **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  * Critical: Within 24-48 hours
  * High: Within 1 week
  * Medium: Within 2-4 weeks
  * Low: Next release cycle

## 🔐 Security Features

### Intelligence Firewall

Misaka Cipher includes a built-in Intelligence Firewall that:

* **Scans all prompts** before sending to external APIs
* **Detects PII**: Social Security Numbers, credit cards, emails, etc.
* **Detects credentials**: API keys, tokens, passwords
* **Routes locally**: Sensitive data processed locally when possible
* **Blocks requests**: Prevents data leakage

### Code Generation Security

The Forge (tool generation system) implements:

* **Syntax validation**: All generated code is parsed before execution
* **Security scanning**: Checks for dangerous imports and operations
* **Sandboxing**: Generated tools run with limited permissions
* **API key isolation**: Generated code cannot access raw API keys

### Agent Security

The Factory (agent spawning system):

* **Resource limits**: Configurable limits on concurrent agents
* **Timeout protection**: Agents automatically terminate after timeout
* **Stateless design**: Agents cannot persist malicious state
* **Isolated execution**: Each agent runs in isolated context

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### API Keys

* **Storage**: API keys are stored in `.env` file (not committed to git)
* **Access**: Only Nexus Core has direct access to API keys
* **Rotation**: We recommend rotating API keys regularly
* **Monitoring**: Monitor your provider dashboards for unusual activity

### Generated Code

* **Review**: Always review generated tools before using in production
* **Validation**: Generated code goes through security validation pipeline
* **Permissions**: Generated tools have limited filesystem access
* **Sandboxing**: Consider running in containers for production use

### Memory System

* **Data Storage**: Episodic memory stores conversation history locally
* **Sensitive Data**: Avoid storing PII in memory system
* **Vector Database**: ChromaDB stores embeddings locally
* **Graph Data**: Knowledge graph stored in JSON format locally

## 🔧 Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management

```bash
# DO: Use environment variables
export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# DON'T: Hardcode in source files
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # ❌ NEVER DO THIS
```

### Configuration

```yaml
# Enable all security features
features:
  enable_intelligence_firewall: true  # Always keep enabled
  
development:
  skip_security_scan: false  # Never skip in production
```

### Environment Isolation

```bash
# Use virtual environments
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Use separate API keys for dev/prod
# Development keys with rate limits
# Production keys with monitoring
```

## 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- [ ] Input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and from trusted sources
- [ ] Code follows principle of least privilege
- [ ] Sensitive operations have proper authorization checks

## 🔍 Security Audits

We welcome security audits and reviews. If you're conducting a security audit:

* Contact us first to coordinate
* Test only on your own instances
* Do not test on shared/public instances
* Do not attempt to access other users' data
* Report findings responsibly
