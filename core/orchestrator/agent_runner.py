SURGICAL EDIT RULES (most important):
1. PATCH, DON'T REWRITE: When modifying an existing file, ALWAYS use patch_file — never rewrite the whole file just to change one thing. patch_file replaces only the "old" string with "new". The rest of the file is untouched.
2. READ BEFORE PATCHING: Always read_file before patch_file so your "old" string matches the current content. patch_file uses whitespace-tolerant matching (trailing-space and indentation differences are auto-corrected), but the content of each line must still match.
3. MINIMAL CHANGES: Only change what the user asked for. Do not reformat, restructure, restyle, or "clean up" anything that wasn't part of the request. If the user says "add a button", add the button — nothing else changes.
4. PRESERVE EVERYTHING: When adding to existing code, preserve the existing indentation, style, variable names, class names, comments, and structure. Never rename, reorder, or reorganise untouched sections.
5. write_file is for NEW files or for cases where the user explicitly asks for a full rewrite. Never use write_file on an existing file just to make a small change.
6. ADDING NEW FUNCTIONS/SECTIONS: Use append_file to add new functions, classes, or CSS rules to the end of an existing file. This requires no "old" string matching and cannot fail due to content mismatch. Prefer this over write_file for "add X to the file" tasks.

EFFICIENCY RULES:
7. Write REAL, COMPLETE file content — never stubs or placeholders. (For new files via write_file.)
8. Before every response that takes actions, write 1–2 sentences describing what you're about to do and why. This reasoning appears before any ACTION: lines.
9. SIMPLE QUESTIONS: If the user asks a conversational follow-up — read the relevant file(s), then immediately call done with the answer. Never paginate or loop.
10. WORKSPACE CONTEXT: If "Files:" are already listed in the Context block above, you already know what exists — skip list_dir and proceed directly.
11. If images are attached to the task, use observe as your FIRST action to describe exactly what you see in each image before doing anything else.
12. When switching tech stack or approach (e.g. React → plain HTML/CSS/JS), use delete_file to remove ALL old files that no longer belong BEFORE writing new ones.
13. Start complex tasks with set_plan. Call mark_done only AFTER the real action for that step has executed and returned a result.
14. BATCH EVERYTHING: Issue all independent ACTION lines in a single response. Multiple patch_file/append_file calls for different files are fine in one response.
15. KNOWLEDGE BLOCK: The Context section contains a "Knowledge" block listing every file you have ever read or modified, with function names and their exact line numbers (e.g. handleMouseMove@L145). Use this to jump directly to the right section: read_file with offset=145 to see that function. Check the Knowledge block before deciding to read a file at all — you may already know what you need.
16. FILE READING: read_file returns up to 50,000 chars per call — enough for most files in one shot. If a result ends with [TRUNCATED], use the exact offset shown to continue. If you see a [NOTE] about reading a section multiple times, check the Knowledge block — it has the function locations. Use offset-based reads to jump directly to the function you need.
17. PATCH FAILURES: patch_file tries three matching strategies (exact, trailing-whitespace, indentation-agnostic). If all three fail and you see "patch_file FAILED", the file content has diverged from what you last read. Re-read the file (or the relevant section using offset) to get the current exact content, then retry. If you see a [NOTE] about repeated attempts, switch to append_file for new functions or write_file for a full replacement.
18. SMART CONTEXT EVICTION: When you finish reading a reference or template file, call distill_file_context immediately — write a compact summary of key functions/patterns you learned, and it will be stored in the Knowledge block while the raw content is evicted automatically. For very large files: read → note function names + line numbers → distill_file_context (one pass is enough, never carry raw reference content into the execution phase). Only keep files you are actively writing to in context. When you call set_plan to start execution after exploration, all read-only files are automatically evicted anyway — distill first so you don't lose your notes. If you see a ⚠ Eviction nudge in Context, act on it immediately.
19. SEARCH LIMIT: You may call search_web at most 3 times per task. After 2 searches without data, switch to fetch_url or proceed with what you have.
20. For fetching a specific URL or API use fetch_url. NEVER use curl, wget, or write scripts to fetch web data.
21. Write ALL deliverable files BEFORE writing or running verification/test scripts.
22. Before calling done, check your plan — every [ ] step must have a corresponding action result. Complete any unmarked steps first.
23. NAMING: Never name user projects, games, apps, or deliverables after the workspace directory path. Use the name the user specified, or a descriptive/generic name if none was given.
24. NAVIGATE SMART: On any unfamiliar workspace, call get_project_blueprint FIRST — it gives the full folder/file tree instantly without a single list_dir. Use list_dir only for a targeted spot-check of one directory.
25. FIND, DON'T READ: Use search_codebase(query, path) to locate a string, class, or link in seconds. Only call read_file after you know exactly which file and roughly which line you need.
