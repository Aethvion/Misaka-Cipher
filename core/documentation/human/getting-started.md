# Getting Started with Aethvion Suite

**Note: This documentation was updated on 2026-04-01 to reflect the current Aethvion Suite (v12) state.**

## Why Aethvion Suite? The Value Proposition

### The Problem with Traditional AI Systems

**Traditional Approach:**
```
User: "I need to analyze 1000 CSV files and generate insights"
AI: "Here's some sample code you can run..."
User: Copies code, debugs errors, manually runs on each file
Result: Hours of manual work, inconsistent quality
```

**AI Wrapper Limitation:**
```
User: Same request
AI Wrapper: Analyzes all 1000 files with GPT-4
Result: $200 in API costs, but automatic execution
```

### The Aethvion Suite Difference

**Current Approach (cloud providers + smart routing):**
```
User: "I need to analyze 1000 CSV files and generate insights"

Aethvion Suite:
1. Recognizes this is a data processing objective.
2. Routes to local model or Gemini Flash for fast, cheap bulk processing.
3. Spawns an agent in a dedicated Workspace to perform the analysis iteratively.
4. Agent documents reusable findings as a Topic in **Persistent Memory**.
5. Routes final strategic insights to Gemini Pro.

Result: Fully automatic, model-agnostic, self-improving system.
```

**Planned Future Approach (once local model support is added):**
```
1. Routes file reading to local Llama model (near-zero cost)
2. Distills raw results with Gemini Flash ($0.10)
3. Routes strategic insights to Gemini Pro ($1.50)
Result: ~$1.60 in API costs vs. $200 with a naive GPT-4 wrapper
```

> **Note:** Local GGUF model inference (via llama-cpp-python) is supported — place models in `localmodels/gguf/`. Local audio models (Kokoro TTS, XTTS-v2, Whisper STT) are available via the Audio Models tab. Full Ollama/vLLM integration for cloud-routing replacement is still on the roadmap.

### The Exponential Advantage

**Why Multi-Provider Support + Model Advancement = Compounding Progress**

1. **Today's Reality:**
    - GPT-4o excels at reasoning
    - Gemini 2.0 Flash is incredibly fast and cheap
    - Each model has different strengths — Misaka routes between them

2. **Tomorrow's Advantage:**
    - GPT-5 releases → Misaka automatically uses it (config change only)
    - Gemini 3 releases → System routes high-stakes tasks there
    - Claude Opus 4 releases → Add to failover chain
    - Local models improve → More tasks run at zero cost (planned)

3. **The Compound Effect:**
    ```
    Week 1: GPT-4o + Gemini Flash
    → System is 2x better than single-model approach

    Month 3: GPT-5 + Gemini 3 + Better local models
    → System is 5x better (model improvements + system learning)

    Year 1: GPT-6 + Gemini 4 + Advanced local models + 500 forged tools
    → System is 20x better (model improvements + massive tool library + deep memory)
    ```

4. **Cost Efficiency at Scale:**
    - Traditional: Every improvement costs more (better model = higher prices)
    - Aethvion Suite: Cost per task decreases over time (smart routing + forged tools reduce cloud API needs)

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Direct AI Interaction

**Scenario:** Ask a question or get help with a problem

**Steps (CLI):**
1. Select `1. Nexus Core`
2. Choose provider (or press Enter for auto-routing)
3. Enter your prompt: "Explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old"
4. Get response with full traceability

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
- Request receives unique Trace ID
- Intelligence Firewall scans for PII/sensitive data
- Router selects optimal provider (Gemini Flash for simple questions)
- Response returns with metadata
- Interaction stored in episodic memory

### Use Case 2: Manage Persistent Memory

**Scenario:** Save an important fact about a project for future agents to use.

**Steps (Web Dashboard):**
1. Select the **Persistent Memory** tab.
2. Click **Create Topic**.
3. Enter Topic: `Project_Alpha_Architecture`.
4. Enter Content: `The project uses a microservices architecture with a shared Redis cache.`
5. Click **Commit**.
6. Future agents spawned for this project will now automatically retrieve this context.

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
- Topic is stored in `data/vault/knowledge/persistent_memory.json`.
- Entry is indexed for semantic retrieval.
- Agents injected with "Project Alpha" context will prioritize this Topic.

### Use Case 3: Spawn a Specialized Agent

**Scenario:** Analyze Python files in a directory

**Steps (CLI):**
1. Select `2. The Factory`
2. Choose `1. Spawn New Agent`
3. Enter agent details:
   ```
   Name: Code_Analysis_Python
   Domain: Code
   Objective: Analyze all Python files in 'src/' directory for complexity metrics
   ```
4. Agent spawns → executes → reports results → terminates

**What the Agent Does:**
- Reads all .py files in src/
- Analyzes complexity (cyclomatic complexity, line counts, etc.)
- Routes analysis to appropriate model (local for reading, Flash for analysis)
- Stores findings in memory
- Returns structured report

### Use Case 4: Set up an Automated AI Task

**Scenario:** Get a daily summary of a research topic every morning.

**Steps (Web Dashboard):**
1. Select the **Schedule** tab.
2. Create a new Task: `Daily Research Summary`.
3. Set the prompt: `Summarize the top AI news from the last 24 hours.`
4. Configure the schedule: `Every day at 9:00 AM`.
5. **Enable Notifications**: Ensure notifications are toggled ON in Settings.
6. Every morning, you'll receive a notification on the dashboard when the task finishes, with a link straight to the results.

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
- Task is persisted in `data/scheduled_tasks/`.
- Background scheduler polls for active tasks.
- On trigger, a transient AI execution context is created.
- Result is stored and a notification event is pushed to the UI.

### Use Case 5: Query System Memory

**Scenario:** Recall past interactions or insights

**Steps (CLI):**
1. Select `4. The Memory Tier`
2. Choose `1. Search Episodic Memory`
3. Enter query: "tool generation"
4. System returns semantically similar past interactions

**Memory Types:**
- **Episodic**: "Remember when I asked you to forge a CSV tool?"
- **Core Insights**: "User frequently requests data analysis tools"
- **Knowledge Graph**: Relationships between concepts, tools, agents

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Then Scale

**Recommended Progression:**
```
Day 1: Basic interactions (Nexus Core)
↓
Day 2: Forge your first tool
↓
Day 3: Spawn your first agent
↓
Week 1: Combine tools + agents for complex tasks
↓
Week 2: Let system run autonomous multi-day projects
```

### 2. Leverage Smart Routing

**Let the System Decide:**
```python
# DON'T: Force expensive model for simple tasks
Request(prompt="Hello", preferred_provider="openai", model="gpt-4o")

# DO: Let router optimize
Request(prompt="Hello")  # Auto-routes to Gemini Flash (cheaper)
```

**Manual Override for Complex Tasks:**
```python
# Complex architectural decision
Request(
    prompt="Design microservices architecture for e-commerce platform",
    preferred_provider="google_ai",
    model="gemini-1.5-pro-latest"  # Force Pro model
)
```

### 3. Use Memory Effectively

**Store Important Insights:**
- After forging a tool → Check memory to see if similar tools exist
- Before starting complex project → Query memory for past similar projects
- Periodic review → "Show me all tools forged this month"

### 4. Monitor System Status

**Regular Health Checks:**
```bash
# Check provider status
Select: 5. System Status → View Provider Health

# Check active operations
Select: 5. System Status → View Active Traces

# Review recent logs
Check: data/logs/system/aethvion.log
```

### 5. Incremental Tool Building

**Build Tools Progressively:**
```
Session 1: Forge basic CSV reader
↓
Session 2: Forge CSV analyzer (uses CSV reader)
↓
Session 3: Forge CSV visualizer (uses analyzer)
↓
Result: Complete data pipeline, each tool tested independently
```

## Configuration & Customization

### Provider Priority

Edit `config/providers.yaml`:

```yaml
providers:
  google_ai:
    priority: 1  # Try first
  openai:
    priority: 2  # Fallback
  grok:
    priority: 3  # Last resort
```

### Model Selection Strategy

Edit `config/model_registry.json`:

```json
{
  "routing_strategy": {
    "verification": "flash",
    "generation": "flash",
    "complex_architecture": "pro",
    "image_generation": "imagen",
    "simple_chat": "flash"
  }
}
```

### Memory Settings

Edit `config/memory.yaml`:

```yaml
episodic_memory:
  enabled: true
  embedding_model: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  max_results: 10

knowledge_graph:
  enabled: true
  auto_update: true
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Provider not available" Error

**Check:**
1. API key is correctly set in `.env`
2. API key has sufficient credits/quota
3. Network connectivity to provider API

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test specific provider
python -c "from providers import ProviderManager; pm = ProviderManager(); print(pm.health_check_all())"
```

### Tool Generation Fails

**Common Issues:**
1. Description too vague → Be specific about inputs/outputs
2. Complex tool requires Pro model → Retry with model override
3. Security validation fails → Review generated code in logs

**Fix:**
```python
# Force Pro model for complex tools
forge.forge_tool(
    description="Your description",
    force_model="gemini-1.5-pro-latest"
)
```

### High API Costs

**Optimization Steps:**
1. Check `data/logs/system/` for routing decisions
2. Verify simple tasks use Flash model, not Pro
3. Use local GGUF models for data processing — place models in `localmodels/gguf/`
4. Review `data/config/model_registry.json` routing strategy (or use the Model Registry in Settings)
