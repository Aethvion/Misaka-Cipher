## The Vibe: This Is Not Just a Chatbot

Aethvion Suite (**M.I.S.A.K.A.** - Multitask Intelligence & Strategic Analysis Kernel Architecture) is fundamentally different from traditional AI assistants. Think of it less as a conversational partner and more as a **Forge for Self-Evolving Software**.

### What Makes Aethvion Suite Different?

**🔄 Self-Evolution at the Core**
- The system doesn't just execute tasks—it solves them by iteratively generating and running code in specialized **Workspaces**.
- Dynamic agents perform multi-step ReAct loops, learning and persisting knowledge as they go.
- The AI can spawn specialized agents, refine its own scripts, and update its memory topics autonomously.
- **Legacy Forging**: The old, manual tool-forging system has been removed in favor of fully autonomous, workspace-specific capability generation.

**♾️ Infinite Session Architecture**
- Designed for long-running, autonomous loops
- Can work continuously until complex goals are achieved
- Examples: "Build a fractal visualization tool" → System works until complete
- Ambitious goals: "Design a fully functioning business" → System iterates autonomously

**🧠 Hybrid Intelligence Strategy**
- Distinguishes between "grunt work" and "reasoning"
- **Low-Cost/High-Volume Tasks**: Reading massive file structures, processing large codebases → Routes to local models (near-zero cost)
- **High-Intelligence/High-Cost Tasks**: Architectural decisions, complex reasoning, strategic planning → Routes to premium cloud models (Gemini Pro, GPT-4)
- Smart cost optimization: Uses local models for data processing, cloud models for insights

**🛡️ Security & Sovereignty First**
- Intelligence Firewall pre-scans all requests for PII and credentials
- Sensitive data automatically routes to local processing
- Complete traceability with unique Trace IDs for every operation

---

## Core Architecture: The Four Pillars

### 1. **Nexus Core** - The Orchestration Brain
The absolute single point of entry for all operations. Every request, whether from a user, an agent, or a tool, flows through Nexus Core.

**Key Features:**
- Unified provider abstraction (Google Gemini, OpenAI, xAI Grok, and future local models)
- Automatic failover between providers
- Trace ID generation for complete auditability
- Intelligence Firewall integration
- Smart routing decisions based on task complexity and sensitivity

### 2. **The Factory & Workspaces** - Agent Execution Engine
Creates specialized worker agents on-demand that operate within dedicated filesystem **Workspaces**. This integrates the old "Forge" logic into a more flexible, iterative execution loop.

**Lifecycle:**
1. User requests a complex goal (e.g., "Analyze this repository for security flaws")
2. Factory analyzes requirements and selects/spawns a specialized agent
3. Agent enters a **Workspace** (a dedicated folder with its own context and files)
4. Agent executes a **ReAct Loop** (Reasoning + Acting: `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_command`, `done`)
5. Results are streamed in real-time to the dashboard via SSE (Server-Sent Events)

### 3. **AI Scheduler & Notifications** - Automated Execution & Alerting
Enables recurring AI tasks and real-time status updates across the entire suite.

**Key Features:**
- **Cron-based Scheduling**: Trigger AI tasks at specific times or intervals (e.g., daily research summaries).
- **Notification Hub**: A centralized, persistent alert system with granular source filtering.
- **Deep-Linking**: Navigate directly from an alert to the relevant task or dashboard tab.

### 4. **The Memory Tier** - Knowledge Persistence & Retrieval
A multi-layered cognitive architecture ensuring that what the system learns today, it remembers tomorrow.

**Layered Architecture:**
- **Persistent Memory (Knowledge Hub)**: Curated, long-term topics and facts managed in the dashboard. This is the top-tier "Ground Truth", now integrated directly into the Chat sidebar.
- **Core Insights**: Recursive summarization of interactions into high-level patterns and behavioral facts.
- **Episodic Memory**: Raw interaction logs with semantic embeddings for vector-based search (ChromaDB).
- **Knowledge Graph**: NetworkX-based mapping showing how domains, agents, and concepts are interlinked.
- **File Vector Store**: Semantic indexing of workspace files for natural language searching.

## How Users Interact: The CLI Experience

### Launch Modes

**Web Interface (Default):**
```bash
python -m core.main
# Access dashboard at http://localhost:8080
# API docs at http://localhost:8080/docs
```

**Interactive CLI:**
```bash
python -m core.main --cli
```

**Verification Tests:**
```bash
python -m core.main --test
```

### CLI Menu Structure

When you launch the CLI, you'll see five main options:

1. **Nexus Core** - Direct AI Interaction
   - Send prompts directly to the AI brain
   - Choose specific providers or use auto-routing
   - Get real-time responses with full traceability

2. **The Factory** - Spawn Agents
   - Create specialized worker agents
   - Define agent specifications (domain, capabilities, objective)
   - Monitor active agents and their status

3. **The Forge** - Generate Tools
   - Describe a tool you need in natural language
   - Watch the system generate, validate, and register it
   - Generated tools immediately available system-wide

4. **The Memory Tier** - Query Knowledge
   - Search episodic memories semantically
   - Query the knowledge graph
   - Retrieve core insights

5. **System Status** - Diagnostics
   - View provider health status
   - Check active traces and operations
   - Monitor resource usage

## The "Infinite Session" Goal

Traditional AI systems handle discrete, bounded tasks. Aethvion Suite aims higher.

### Vision: Autonomous Goal Achievement

**Simple Example:**
```
User: "Create a fractal visualization tool"
System:
1. Analyzes requirements → Routes to Pro model for architecture
2. Forges base visualization tool → Uses Flash model for code generation
3. Tests and validates → Local execution
4. Identifies missing dependencies → Forges installer tool
5. Generates documentation → Uses Flash for writing
6. Creates example fractals → Uses Imagen for images
7. Validates complete system → Final check
Result: Fully functional fractal tool, tested and documented
```

**Ambitious Example:**
```
User: "Design a fully functioning e-commerce business for handmade crafts"
System (over days/weeks):
1. Business analysis → Pro model for strategic planning
2. Market research → Flash model reading competitor sites (local caching)
3. Architecture design → Pro model for system design
4. Code generation → Spawns multiple agents for frontend, backend, database
5. Tool forging → Creates custom analytics, inventory management tools
6. Testing → Spawns QA agents
7. Documentation → Flash model for comprehensive docs
8. Deployment → Forges deployment tools
Result: Complete business platform, ready to launch
```

### How It Works

**Continuous Loop:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Parse Goal into Subgoals        │
└──────────┬──────────────────────────┘
           │
┌──────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│ 2. For Each Subgoal:                │
│    - Assess Complexity              │
│    - Route to Appropriate Model     │
│    - Spawn Agents if Needed         │
│    - Forge Tools if Missing         │
└──────────┬──────────────────────────┘
           │
┌──────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│ 3. Execute & Validate               │
│    - Store Results in Memory        │
│    - Update Knowledge Graph         │
└──────────┬──────────────────────────┘
           │
┌──────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│ 4. Goal Complete?                   │
│    No → Back to Step 2              │
│    Yes → Present Final Result       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why This Architecture Matters

### 1. **Wrapper Support + Model Advancement = Exponential Progress**

As AI models improve (GPT-5, Gemini 3, Claude Opus 4), Aethvion Suite automatically benefits. The wrapper provides:
- Consistent interface regardless of underlying model
- Automatic failover to best available model
- Cost optimization through smart routing
- Future-proof architecture

### 2. **Cost-Efficient Scaling**

Traditional approach: Use expensive cloud models for everything
```
Read 1000 files with GPT-4 → $$$$$
Analyze results with GPT-4 → $$$$$
Make decisions with GPT-4 → $$$$$
```

Aethvion Suite approach:
```
Read 1000 files with Local Llama → $ (near zero)
Distill insights with Flash → $
Strategic decisions with Pro → $$
Total: 90% cost reduction
```

### 3. **Self-Improving System**

Each tool forged expands the system's capabilities:
- Week 1: 10 basic tools
- Week 4: 50 tools (system forged 40 new ones)
- Week 12: 200 tools (exponential growth)

The system becomes more capable without human intervention.
